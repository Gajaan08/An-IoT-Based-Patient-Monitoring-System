# An-IoT-Based-Patient-Monitoring-System
• Remotely monitoring a patient and giving data to a doctor.

• Get the patient parameters of heart rate, blood oxygen level, body temperature, and respiratory rate using sensors and 
updating data to the cloud.

• Used Machine learning algorithms and cloud data to detect the anomaly activities in the ECG graph and alert the 
doctor about the patient's health.

• Physical implementation works and the project now going onward.
